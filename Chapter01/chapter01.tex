\section{What Is Analysis?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{6/14:}\textbf{Analysis}: \dq{The rigorous study of [mathematical] objects, with a focus on trying to pin down precisely and accurately the qualitative and quantitative behavior of those objects}{1}
    \item \textbf{Real analysis}: \dq{The analysis of the real numbers, sequences and series of real numbers, and real-valued functions}{1}
    \item Real analysis is the theoretical foundation for \textbf{calculus}.
    \item \textbf{Calculus}: \dq{The collection of computational algorithms which one uses to manipulate functions}{1}
    \item Lists questions that can be answered with real analysis (motivation for studying it).
\end{itemize}



\section{Why Do Analysis?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lists examples of contradictions in na\"{i}ve calculus that must be resolved (and can be resolved with real analysis).
